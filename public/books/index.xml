      <description>Summary Conventional models of voting behavior depict individuals who judge governments for how the world unfolds during their time in office. This phenomenon of retrospective voting requires that individuals integrate and appraise streams of performance information over time. Yet past experimental studies short-circuit this &amp;lsquo;integration-appraisal&amp;rsquo; process. In this Element, we develop a new framework for studying retrospective voting and present eleven experiments building on that framework. Notably, when we allow integration and appraisal to unfold freely, we find little support for models of &amp;lsquo;blind retrospection.</description>

      <description>Summary The conventional wisdom of economic voting theory argues that a nation&amp;rsquo;s economic performance drives electoral outcomes. Therefore, voters will hold an administration accountable for its economic stewardship. Austin Hart challenges the simplicity of this notion, drawing on cognitive-psychological research on priming to demonstrate that the intensity of voters&amp;rsquo; exposure to economic campaign messages systematically conditions the strength of the economic vote. However, this study goes further than simply saying &amp;lsquo;campaigns matter&amp;rsquo;.</description>
