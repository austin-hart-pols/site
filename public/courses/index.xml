      <description>SIS-750 This course introduces the art and practice of data analysis using R and RMarkdown. It focuses on the preparation of data (data wrangling or munging), professional presentation of data and analysis, and the process of producing scalable, replicable work (statistical and literate programming). More than just learning the requisite code, I emphasize the professional outputs associated with a career in data analysis. This semester is a chance to get your hands dirty in the world of analysis and explore the new and challenging puzzles you face every day in this profession.</description>

      <description>SIS-806 This course provides an introduction to statistical methods used in international relations research. After learning about the structure of causal analysis we will cover several common research strategies. As we do so, we will learn a series of statistical techniques for evaluating empirical relationships. Throughout the course we will focus on the generation and interpretation of statistical analyses and what they can and cannot tell us about the phenomena we hope to explain.</description>

      <description>SIS-306 This applied research course focuses on large N quantitative analysis, specifically the use of statistical techniques explain explain real world socio-political phenomena. Students acquire skills needed to solve common analytical quests and questions, including the acquisition, management, manipulation, estimation and interpretation of findings from large sample data, using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Students also learn common techniques for displaying and communicating findings for professional and lay audiences, culminating in the development of an original research project.</description>

      <description>SIS-600 Effective research design is vital to answering questions about international affairs. Quantitative statistical techniques are an important and widespread part of this research: assessing empirical relationships over large numbers of observations. Engaging in scholarship and policymaking requires an ability to employ the tools, interpret the results, and understand the implications of statistical analysis. This course will introduce the basics of statistical methodology and train students to be critical consumers and capable producers of empirical research.</description>
