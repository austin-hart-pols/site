      <description>SIS-806 This theme has a form-to-email feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration. All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form (/content/forms/contact.md). Of course, the example shown below (your@email.here) must not be used. Please use your actual email address.&#xA;Update that file and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to begin receiving submissions. Just submit the active form for the first time, and complete the email address verification step with Formspree, and your contact form is live.</description>
