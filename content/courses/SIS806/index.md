### SIS-806
This course provides an introduction to statistical methods used in international relations research. After learning about the structure of causal analysis we will cover several common research strategies. As we do so, we will learn a series of statistical techniques for evaluating empirical relationships. Throughout the course we will focus on the generation and interpretation of statistical analyses and what they can and cannot tell us about the phenomena we hope to explain.

This course will train students to be critical consumers of empirical research and capable producers of statistical analyses. First, the course will provide students with the analytic tools needed to evaluate causal claims made on the basis of empirical study. By the end of the semester, students will be able to critique study designs, recognize common sources of bias, and suggest appropriate remedies. Second, this course will train students to use statistical techniques, including multivariate regression analysis, to answer research questions on their own. Students will learn (i) how to obtain and format data, (ii) how to summarize and evaluate empirical relationships, (iii) how to make appropriate inferences based on their analyses, and (iv) how to present statistical results to a general audience.
