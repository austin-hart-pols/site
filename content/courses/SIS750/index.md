### SIS-750

This course introduces the art and practice of data analysis using R and RMarkdown. It focuses on the preparation of data (data wrangling or munging), professional presentation of data and analysis, and the process of producing scalable, replicable work (statistical and literate programming). More than just learning the requisite code, I emphasize the professional outputs associated with a career in data analysis. This semester is a chance to get your hands dirty in the world of analysis and explore the new and challenging puzzles you face every day in this profession.

Students who complete this course will be proficient junior analysts. They will be able to:

- build, clean, and manipulate quantitative data
- generate professional data visualizations
- present data-driven research to a professional audience
