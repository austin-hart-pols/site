### SIS-600
Effective research design is vital to answering questions about international affairs. Quantitative statistical techniques are an important and widespread part of this research: assessing empirical relationships over large numbers of observations. Engaging in scholarship and policymaking requires an ability to employ the tools, interpret the results, and understand the implications of statistical analysis. This course will introduce the basics of statistical methodology and train students to be critical consumers and capable producers of empirical research.

Required course for most MA students in SIS. Offered every term.
